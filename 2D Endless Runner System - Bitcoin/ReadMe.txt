Thanks for installing the asset!

Briefly about the purpose of each script:
- BackgroungCreator	(draws a background consisting of rectangular cells)
- Line			(draws a trail behind the player)
- Player			(here are described such functions for the gradual acceleration of the game and the limitations of the game space)
- Touch			(tracking screen taps)

All blocks in scripts are commented out, so I think there will be no problems. Otherwise, write to the mail isleofassets@gmail.com
